## Legal
Tactical Intervention Revived is a fan project to restore the abadonware game Tactical Intervention.

Tactical Intervention was a free-to-play game released on Steam, developed by Fix Korea Games. Fix Korea Games no longer exists and Tactical Intervention Revived is considered abandonware. The intent of this project is simply to maintain the old state of the game in the best state possible. 

If the IP owner of Tactical Intervention wishes, Tactical Intervention Revived will be removed immediatley.

## Why does it need administrator permissions?
To enable Tactical Intervention Revived's awesome mod support, all the game content files are linked to the game directory virtually with symlinks. To create symlinks on Windows, administrator permissions are required. These symlinks create a 'portal' to files in other locations, tricking the source engine to load the virtual file system that Tactical Intervention Revived creates.
